		<div id="redmi"><h2>Redmi</h2>
			<p>Redmi is a sub-brand owned by the Chinese electronics company Xiaomi.
			It was first announced in July 2013 as a budget smartphone line, and
			became a separate sub-brand of Xiaomi in 2019 with entry-level and mid-range devices, 
			while Xiaomi itself produces upper-range and flagship Mi phones. 
			Redmi phones use the Xiaomi MIUI user interface on top of Android.
			Models can be divided into the entry-level Redmi phones with display usually up to 6" and the mid-range
			Redmi Note series with displays exceeding 5" and equipped with higher-end specifications.
			The low-end Redmi A series and Redmi Go have been marketed in several Asian and European countries.
			The most significant difference from other Xiaomi smartphones is that they use less-expensive
			components and thus have lower prices with reduced specification.
			In August 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that in the second quarter of the 2014 fiscal year,
			Xiaomi had a market share of 14% of smartphone shipment rankings in China.
			Redmi sales were attributed as a contributing factor toward this gain in shipment rankings.

		<div id="samsung"><h2>Samsung</h2>
			<p>Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas 
			including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered the electronics
			industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s;
			these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987,
			Samsung was separated into four business groups â€“ Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group.
			Since 1990, Samsung has increasingly globalised its activities and electronics;
			in particular, its mobile phones and semiconductors have become its most important source of income.
			As of 2017, Samsung has the 6th highest global brand value.
